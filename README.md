# Tutor's helper

Tutor's helper is a full stack web platform for personal tutors to coordinate classes with their students. It's designed to take the chore out of payment management, class bookings, giving feedback and more. A lightweight forum is also included for students to interact with one another.

In short, Tutor's helper is a CRM for personal tutors.

Note: This is version 0.1 and many aspects have not yet been tested for reliability. Use in an actual tutor-student setting is discouraged for now.
